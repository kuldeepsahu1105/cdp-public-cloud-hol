== Overview

Hands-on Labs play a crucial role in showcasing the capabilities of Cloudera Data Platform Public Cloud form factor to partners and customers. They offer a practical and immersive learning experience that goes beyond mere overview. Hands-on Labs facilitate participant engagement and allow them to explore and interact with different PaaS offerings of Cloudera Data Platform.


Infrastructure components are important and play a vital role in acheieving the goal of Hands-on Labs and to give a better experience to the participants.

**Hands On Labs Infrastructure Provisioner** is a container based solution which takes care of provisioning the required infrastaructure components without much manual efforts. By executing a single command it creates a **disposable** on-demand stack consists of:

1. CDP Environment
2. Datalake
3. Data Service (Currently CDW & CDE)
4. Keycloak Server
5. Users 


== Technology Stack
**Hands On Labs Infrastructure Provisioner** employs a robust toolchain consisting of:


1.  Ansible
2.  Terraform
3.  Cloudera.cloud
4.  CDP-tf-quickstarts
5.  CDPY
6.  CDP CLI
7.  AWS CLI
8.  Shell Scripting

All the above tools are integrated with each other and packaged as a Dokcer Container for use.

== How To Create Docker Image for HoL-Automation

=== Step 1: Clone the code and cd into the hol_automation/build directory

[.shell]
----

cd hol_automation/build

----

---

=== Step 2: Build the docker image

[.shell]
----

# docker build . -t <reponame>/<imagename>:<tagname>
docker build . -t hol:latest

----
To verify the Docker image is actually created, by image ID or Name:
[.shell]
----

docker images

----

---

=== Step 3: Login to Docker Hub
The docker image is available at Docker Hub. Once the Docker is installed and ready to use pull the **cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest** image by executing below command.


[.shell]
----

[ec2-user@ipaserver ~]$ docker login
Emulate Docker CLI using podman. Create /etc/containers/nodocker to quiet msg.
Username: clouderapartners
Password: 
Login Succeeded!
[ec2-user@ipaserver ~]$ 

----

---

=== Step 4: Tag and Push the Docker Image
The Docker image will be available at Docker Hub. Once the Docker is installed, and you are logged in to Docker Hub, push the **cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest** image by executing below command.


[.shell]
----

docker tag hol:latest clouderapartners/cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest
docker push clouderapartners/cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest

----

The overall time for provisioning is nearly 80-150 minutes (Total Time = Time Reqd for DataLake Provisioning + Time Reqd for CDE and/or CDW Provisioning). 

---

=== The Outcome
==== Keycloak:
The succesful execution of image will generate a .txt file in 'userconfig' folder on your local machine. The name of the file will be <VALUE_OF_WORKSHOP_NAME>.txt
e.g : If in the configfile the value of WORKSHOP_NAME is **accn-wrkshp** the out put file will be **accn-wrkshp.txt**

This file contains details about the provisioned Keycloak Server and the SSO URL which will be used for participants for login. It will look similar like below

|Environment
|<WORKSHOP_NAME>-cdp-env; e.g : accn-workshp-cdp-env

|Admin User Group
|<WORKSHOP_NAME>-aw-cdp-admin-group; e.g: accn-workshp-aw-cdp-admin-group

|User Group
|<WORKSHOP_NAME>-aw-cdp-user-group; e.g: accn-workshp-aw-cdp-user-group

|===

---

==== CDW

Based on number of workshop users defined in configfile the provisioner will take care of deploying required number of **xsmall** warehouses of both Hive & Impala and a
data visualization cluster of **large** size.

|Data Visualization(large)
|<WORKSHOP_NAME>-data-viz; e.g: accn-workshp-data-viz

|===

---

==== CDE
Based on number of workshop users defined in configfile the provisioner will take care of activating CDE service and deploying required number of CDE Virtual clusters having **SPARK 2** configuration. Based on the scope of workshop the owner needs to grant access through Ranger manually.

|Virtual Clusters

|===

---

The provisioned CDP environment will have all the Keycloak users created in CDP and assigned to the *-aw-cdp-user-group and synched to FreeIpa.

[NOTE]
During provisioning, the process creates files and hidden folder inside the local userconfig folder. Do not delete any
files and folder as these are required for destroying the stack.
